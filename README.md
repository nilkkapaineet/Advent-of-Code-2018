# Advent-of-Code-2018
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

The change to each acre is based entirely on the contents of that acre as well as the number of open, wooded, or lumberyard acres adjacent to it at the start of each minute. Here, "adjacent" means any of the eight acres surrounding that acre. (Acres on the edges of the lumber collection area might have fewer than eight adjacent acres; the missing acres aren't counted.)

In particular:

An open acre will become filled with trees if three or more adjacent acres contained trees. Otherwise, nothing happens.
An acre filled with trees will become a lumberyard if three or more adjacent acres were lumberyards. Otherwise, nothing happens.
An acre containing a lumberyard will remain a lumberyard if it was adjacent to at least one other lumberyard and at least one acre containing trees. Otherwise, it becomes open.
These changes happen across all acres simultaneously, each of them using the state of all acres at the beginning of the minute and changing to their new form by the end of that same minute. Changes that happen during the minute don't affect each other.
