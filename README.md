# Advent-of-Code-2018
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

After exploring a little, you discover a long tunnel that contains a row of small pots as far as you can see to your left and right. A few of them contain plants - someone is trying to grow things in these geothermally-heated caves.

The pots are numbered, with 0 in front of you. To the left, the pots are numbered -1, -2, -3, and so on; to the right, 1, 2, 3.... Your puzzle input contains a list of pots from 0 to the right and whether they do (#) or do not (.) currently contain a plant, the initial state. (No other pots currently contain plants.) For example, an initial state of #..##.... indicates that pots 0, 3, and 4 currently contain plants.

Your puzzle input also contains some notes you find on a nearby table: someone has been trying to figure out how these plants spread to nearby pots. Based on the notes, for each generation of plants, a given pot has or does not have a plant based on whether that pot (and the two pots on either side of it) had a plant in the last generation. These are written as LLCRR => N, where L are pots to the left, C is the current pot being considered, R are the pots to the right, and N is whether the current pot will have a plant in the next generation.
